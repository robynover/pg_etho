- Sync buttons
	x - "sync" (1-way save) TO cloud (iris)
	- from cloud (iris)

- Connect with CouchDB on local Ubuntu VM <-- big trouble with that! host routing probs between android and local and VM

- "Save to remote" option -- put in footer bar so it's always available

- Create new file/object for UI stuff -- adding header elements, applying templates, etc

- Activity form should remember your last choice so that you don't have to page thru menus again (but ALSO let you back up! See below)

-Issues with scrolling back through dynamically generated page views - example: the tabbed menu (activities) that turns into a form exists on the same "page" and there's not a way to get back to the menu list ... just need *back buttons* maybe

-Highight top level tabs on nav (observer, sightings, etc)

- ~~~~ideas~~~~ maybe more swipe actions btw tabs

NOTES
-- running on mamp, with virtualhost redirect as http://phonegap.local:8888/

- several different push/sync scenarios:
	* push to local server (using push here to mean send to server only, don't get data back)
	* sync with local server 
	* push to remote server (might be cloudant or ethoinformatics.org)
	* sync with remote server

- running into CORS issues with cloudant. iriscouch works but is often offline, and doesn't require username/password. on phonegap (in device) it may work, tho: http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.8.0rc1/guide_whitelist_index.md.html#Domain%20Whitelist%20Guide and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phonegap/dwGtFt_gFuQ

- 12/20: tried working with menubutton event, but it has strange behaviour -- only fires sometimes ... seems to fire if you go from browser, straight to app, hit back button, and then go straight back to app ... ???

- For template files how-to, see http://www.jblotus.com/2011/05/24/keeping-your-handlebars-js-templates-organized/


NEXT UP:
- run couch db from ubuntu virtual machine and try to connect via REST
	alternately, try to run pouchDB from within phoneGap
	alternately, build a node app with heroku and use couchDB there, using node instead of php
